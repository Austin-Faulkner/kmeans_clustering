The kmeans clustering .py python script is run:

      'python3 kmeans.py k input.txt'

where k is the number of clusters and input.txt is one of the
files: 'input1.txt' (k=2), 'input2.txt' (k=2), 'input3.txt' (k=3),
or 'input4.txt' (k=4).

Remark: the output may vary the indices assignment, but the clusters are always the same, as 
is evidenced by the screenshots and gen.exe.
